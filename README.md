# nsight

The nsight platform will allow nology staff members to get better insight on the courses we're running, as well as the employment/placement rate of our students.

## Bootstrap

We will be using the grid layout system from BootStrap. 

## Naming Folders & Files

In order to ensure compatiably between Unix and Windows operating systems it's important that we name all our files and folders in lowercase. For example, we would name a component nav.jsx as opposed to Nav.jsx.

## File Structure 

All components should be that belong to one page should be created within the pages folder. Child components should be nested within the folder of their parent. For example, if navlink was a child component of register the file structure would look like this. Remeber that test files should have .spec.js as the file extention.
              
### Note 
All components that are shared between pages should be contained within the shared folder as opposed to pages</p>
